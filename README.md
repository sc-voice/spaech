### Spaech: an auto-encoder compression library for individual speakers

Although auto-encoder nerual networkss can be used for compression,
generally speaking, they offer no special advantage over existing 
hand-coded compression algorithms such as MP3. 
In fact, MP3 provides an already impressive ~7-8x compression factor.

However, it is possible to surpass existing compression standards with an auto-encoder
if we restrict our compression to speech from an individual speaker.
With such a speaker, an auto-encoder can optimize the encoding of sounds
unique to that speaker's voice.
Indeed, the auto-encoder approach works most efficiently for speakers with consistent diction and restrained affect.
